Here it is a little review about some of the most important physics phenomena:

**Deterministic chaos and Feigenbaum graphic**: study of a logistic map to illustrate chaos phenomena
**Photoelectric effect**: representation of pairs (frecuency, potential) with linear fit and least squares method
**Diffraction gratings**: diffraction pattern of a slit 
**Eigenstates of a square well potential and their energies**: review of the eigenstates and eigenenergies of a square well potential
**Fourier transform**: noise removal of functions using Fourier transform 
**Electric field created by two opposite charges**: electric field lines of two opposite charges 
**Lorenz equations**: representation of Lorenz equations to see the famous 'Lorenz Attractor' related with chaos theory
**Model of thermal diffusion in the Earth's crust**: using FTCS method to solve diffusion equation with a boundary condition related to Earth's temperature
